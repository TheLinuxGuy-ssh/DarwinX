## Features Added: 

- Window Draggable
- Window Open and Close with dock and topbar buttons
- Appcompiler defined for increased scalability for the future

you might not find much to do here since the project has been a lot more focused on backend and its super efficient scalability, with the best possible methods of scalability in terms of apps with lots of features such as appcompilers as a way for the future of the project to make external apps installable on the simulator by its future community

## What works:
- The glass UI feel to the whole environment
- All dock interactions leaving the applauncher
- Topbar Simulation (no interaction) with status changing with the current app focused
- All window interaction

## How to run and Develop:

- First install all nodejs dependencies with `npm install`
- proceed to launch the local server with `npm run dev`
- Voila you are up!!
