            you might not find much to do here since the project has been a lot more focused on backend, with the best possible methods of scalability in terms of apps with lots of features such as appcompilers as a way for the future of the project to make external apps installable on the simulator by its future community
        <br /><br />
        What works:
        <li>The appmenu present at the start of the dock</li>
        <li>The glass UI feel to the whole environment</li>
        <li>The Window functions such as focus and all application handling such as close, minimise and maximise.</li>
        <li>All dock interactions leaving the applauncher</li>
        <li>Topbar Simulation (no interaction) with status changing with the current app focused</li>
        <li><b>A flexible application handling backend along with an installer(visible only in backend) for the future community to post apps for the project</b></li>
